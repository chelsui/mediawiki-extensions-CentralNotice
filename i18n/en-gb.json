To always show a step, leave the 'Skip with identifier' field blank. If an identifier is set, then once the step has completed, a flag will be stored in the user's browser using that identifier, and the next time the user reaches a step with the same identifier, it will be skipped. Identifiers from the 'Large banner limit and switch' mixin are compatible and will also be taken into account. Once a sequence finishes, it starts again from the beginning. (To prevent a sequence from repeating, use the 'Impression diet' mixin to limit impressions.)"
